## Instructions

You can download a working version in releases page.

On left panel you can pick size of map generate. Larger maps will take longer to generate but will be more detailed. You can also adjust amount of continental plates in the world. More plates generally mean more mountains. 

After generating you can use the controls in lower left corner to save maps. Just give the map a name and press save. Saved maps are found in: C:/Users/user/AppData/Roaming/Godot/app_userdata/World Maker

Also after generating there are buttons to adjust map with additional erosion etc.
